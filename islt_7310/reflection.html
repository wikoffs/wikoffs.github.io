    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <br />
    <main>Working for the University of Missouri Extension has taught me so much about my myself. It has been a 
        career that in only three short years, I have grown leaps and bounds. The position as a Nutrition and Health 
        Specialist and County Engagement Specialist has been rewarding, yet very challenging.
        <br />
        I have two important parts to career; one part is the role of the County Engagement Specialist. As the County 
        Engagement Specialist, I am the county program director of a very rural county in Missouri, called Bates County. 
        I am also the interim County Engagement Specialist for Vernon County. I work with stakeholders in the community 
        on a daily basis. I also assist the Bates County Extension Council, where I attend council meeting and events. 
        This role also comes with a lot of challenges, that I have had to navigate through. Many challenges involving 
        budget cuts. Overall, I serve as the liaison between the Bates County Extension Council and the University of Missouri.
        <br />
        The other counterpart to my career is the Nutrition and Health Specialist. In this role, I serve three rural counties in Missouri. 
        The three counties I serve include: Bates, Cedar, and Vernon Counties. In these counties I teach a variety of nutrition and health programs.
        Participants come from all different backgrounds and walks of life. I believe in the power of educating, and I truly enjoy teaching individuals. 
        It gives me great pride in my work, when a participant tells how the program/class has made a difference in their life. 
        I believe in the importance of self-care and self-love. I strive to help others living a healthy mind, body, and soul lifestyle.

    <h2>Career Aspiration</h2>
        My overall professional goal is to always try to grow and improve in my career. With having the goal to enhance my career
        and challenge myself, I decided to pursue my Ph.D. In May 2021, I was accepted into the Ph.D. Program of Learning, Teaching, 
        and Curriculum with a Science Education. I will also have an emphasis in Online Education, and will earn the Online Educator 
        Graduate Certificate. With a Ph.D. I will get to advance my career in Extension and be able to explore other opportunities. 
        Since I have a love for teaching, one thing I would like to do with a Ph.D. is to teach at a college level. 
        I am excited to see where I will be in ten years with my career and how this professional decision will positively affect my personal life. 
        At the end of the day, I am pursing my Ph.D. for not only myself, but my family.</main>

<title>Welcome to Sara Bridgewater's Website</title>

<body>
Hello! My name is Sara Bridgewater. My husband, Harley, our son, Teddy, and I live outside of Rich Hill, Missouri in the country. I’m currently a Nutrition and Health Specialist for the University of Missouri Extension, where I provide health and nutrition programs to the communities I serve.  I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Learning, Teaching, and Curriculum at the University of Missouri. 
As far as my background in web application and development training, I have little experience. In high school, I actually had the opportunity to learn how to make updates to the school’s website. However, it was very basic and I have a lot to learn. My expectation for the course is learning to build a website from scratch. I am hoping to gain skills that I can apply to my everyday work. In my free time, I enjoy sending time outside, traveling, and spending time with my family.

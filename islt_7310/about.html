            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Sara Bridgewater and I work for the University of Missouri Extension.
                 For college, I attended Missouri State University. In 2015, I graduated with 
                 my Bachelor of Science in Health Services. In 2017, I graduated with my 
                 Master’s in Public Health. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Learning, 
                 Teaching, and Curriculum, with an emphasis in Science Education and Online 
                 Learning at the University of Missouri. I am certified in many health programs,
                  including Tai Chi and Walk With Ease. I am a Nutrition and Health Specialist and 
                  serve three rural counties in Missouri. I strive to help people and families live 
                  healthier lifestyles and connect with their community. Daily I provide nutrition 
                  and health programming to the counties I serve. Every day I get to serve, work 
                  with volunteers, and give back to the community I grew up in. </p>

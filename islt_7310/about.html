    Hello! My name is Sara Bridgewater and I work for the University of Missouri Extension. For college, I attended Missouri State University. In 2015, I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Health Services. In 2017, I graduated with my Master’s in Public Health. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Learning, Teaching, and Curriculum, with an emphasis in Science Education and Online Learning at the University of Missouri. I am certified in many health programs, including Tai Chi and Walk With Ease. I am a Nutrition and Health Specialist and serve three rural counties in Missouri. I strive to help people and families live healthier lifestyles and connect with their community. Daily I provide nutrition and health programming to the counties I serve. Every day I get to serve, work with volunteers, and give back to the community I grew up in.

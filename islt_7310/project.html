                        <p>I provide nutrition and health programs to three counties in Missouri.   I partner with many stakeholders and orgnanizations in the communities I serve. I teach classes involving Diabetes, Healthy Cooking Classes, Excercise Classes,
                            Fall Prevention Class, and many more! Some classes we are also able to create! This past year some of my colleagues and I created a Spin Club for International Foods. The program is design to teach kids about other countires and they get to make a recipe from that country.</p>
